# What is H2O?

It is the only alternative to combine the power of highly advanced algorithms, the freedom of open source, and the capacity of truly scalable in-memory processing for big data on one of many nodes. Combined, these capabilities make it faster, easier, and more cost-effective to harness big data to maximum benefit for the business.

Data collection is easy. Decision making is hard. H2O makes it fast and easy
to derive insights from your data through faster and better predictive modeling. Existing Big Data stacks are batch-oriented. Search and analytics need to be interactive. Use machines to learn machine-generated data. And more data beats better algorithms.

With H2O, you can make better predictions by harnessing sophisticated, ready-to- use algorithms and the processing power you need to analyze bigger data sets, more models, and more variables.

Get started with minimal effort and investment. H2O is an extensible open source platform that offers the most pragmatic way to put big data to work for your busi- ness. With H2O, you can work with your existing languages and tools. Further, you can extend the platform seamlessly into your Hadoop environments.
